## Inspiration

The inspiration for CatchUp came during this hackathon, when one of us realized just how far behind we were in our coursework — we have an exam on Monday and over 100 unread pages to study. The pressure to both prepare for the exam and participate in the hackathon created a desperate need for a better way to catch up. This moment of stress and urgency sparked the idea for CatchUp — a platform designed to help students quickly get back on track with personalized, AI-driven study plans.

## Technologies Used

**Backend**: Google's Breadboard library for prototyping generative AI applications.

**AI Models**: Large Language Models (LLMs) for content generation and student knowledge assessment.

**Frontend**: React for building the user interface.
